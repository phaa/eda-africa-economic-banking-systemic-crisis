# Exploratory Data Analysis: Economic and Banking Crises in Africa

This project uses the *Africa Economic, Banking and Systemic Crisis Data* dataset, available on Kaggle, to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify patterns and trends related to the frequency and distribution of economic and banking crises in African countries. This project was developed during an introductory data analysis course in the Technology in Internet Systems undergraduate program at IFRN.

## Tools Used

* **Python**: Main language for data manipulation and visualization.
* **Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating detailed charts and visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and presenting the code and results.

## Main Analyses

1.  Frequency of crises across decades.
2.  Comparison between banking and economic crises.
3.  Analysis of the geographical and temporal distribution of crises.
   
## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/phaa/eda-africa-economic-banking-systemic-crisis.git
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Open the Jupyter notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook frequencia-e-distribuicao-crises.ipynb
    ```

## Repository Structure

* frequencia-e-distribuicao-crises.ipynb: Notebook containing the analysis and results.
* requirements.txt: File with the necessary dependencies.
* data/: Directory to store the dataset.

## Notes

This project is for academic purposes and aims to demonstrate how data analysis can be applied to understand complex events.
